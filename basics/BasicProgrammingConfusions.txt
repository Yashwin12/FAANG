1) return null; vs return;
// HACK: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8749091/should-a-function-use-return-null
If you don't return anything, just use return; or omit it at all at the end of the function.
If your function is usually returns something ( non-premitive data type ) but doesn't for some reason, return null; is the way to go.

//HACK: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17221759/returning-null-in-a-method-whose-signature-says-return-int
Also method returning primitive data type can't return null; 

2) Primitive vs non-primitive Data Type:

3) BINARY TREE VS BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST):

A binary tree is a non linear data structure where each node can have at most 2 child nodes. ... Binary search tree is a binary tree in which a node have a value greater than all values in its left subtree and smaller than all values in its right subtree.

4) Binary Search:
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. Refer BinarySearchAlgo.java

5) Skewed Tree 
A skewed tree is a tree where each node has only one child node or none. A binary tree, which is dominated solely by ( chain of ) left child nodes or right child nodes, is called a skewed binary tree, more specifically left skewed binary tree, or right skewed binary tree.

QUESTION JARGON
1) Increasing vs Non-decreasing: 
Increasing means that every element is greater than the one before it. Non-decreasing means that no element is less than the element before it, or in other words: that every element is greater than or equal to the one before it

2) In-place: 
In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array.

3) One pass OR Single-pass: 
In computing, a one-pass algorithm is a streaming algorithm which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded buffering. A one-pass algorithm generally requires O(n) time and less than O(n) storage (typically O(1)), where n is the size of the input.
